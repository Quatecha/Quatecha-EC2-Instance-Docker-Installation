2. Install PuTTY on your local machine.
3. Load your private key pair in PuTTYgen.
4. Configure PuTTY settings to connect to your EC2 instance.

## Installing Docker on the EC2 Instance
1. Update the package index by running `sudo yum update -y`.
2. Install Docker using `sudo yum install docker -y`.
3. Start the Docker service with `sudo systemctl start docker`.
4. Verify the installation by running `sudo docker run hello-world`.
5. Enable the Docker service to start automatically with `sudo systemctl enable docker`.
6. Check the Docker version with `docker --version`.
7. Optionally, add your user to the Docker group to run Docker commands without `sudo`.

## Conclusion
Installing Docker on Amazon Linux is a straightforward process that involves a few simple steps. By following this guide, you should be able to set up Docker on your EC2 instance and begin deploying your applications efficiently.
